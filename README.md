-Knows how to learn new computing skills independently.
  # Data Analytics skills
-Machine learning 
-data visualization

# Data Analytic roles:
*Data collection & preparation
* Data Analysis
* Data visualization &storytelling
* Decision support
* Collaboration & communication
* Continuous learning & adaptation
  # Data Analytic Responsibilities :
-Manages the delivery of user satisfaction surveys    & report on results using data visualization software
-Work with business line owners to develop requirements,define success metrics,manage & execute analytical pojects and evaluate results.

-Design,Build,Test & maintain backend code.
 # Steps When approaching a new project
*Define the questions-defining a problem
*Collect data-primary/internal
*Clean the data-prepare& fix the missing data
*Analyze data
*Interprete & share the solution /results

 For data analytics to prosper there has to be: Data, Storage & Computing
  # Processes for data analaytics:
-Data acquistion
-Cleaning & manipulation
-Analysis,Visualization,Reporting & Communication
 # Data Analytic Techniques
Descriptive,Predictive & Prescriptive


Artificial intelligence (AI) includes any type of technique where you are attempting to get a computer system to imitate human behavior.
Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI techniques.
Deep learning is a further subdivision of machine learning that uses quite complex techniques, known as neural networks, to discover knowledge in a particular way. Used for image,video & sound.
Data Governance programs: ensures that the organization has high-data quality & able to effectively control the data
# Analytics tool
Excel or Google sheets

 # CHAPTER 2 !!!!
 # Tools for representing tabular data
*Microsoft Excel
*Google Sheets
*Apple numbers
Connection  between tables-- Relationship
Database softwares: Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL & Postgre SQL.

Structured data- organized into row & column
# Data Types:
-Character,text,Alphanumeric,clob &longtext
ASCII- includes upper & lowercase alphabets &numbers
Structured Data
Tabular data is structured data, with values stored in a consistent, defined manner, organized into columns and rows.
Unstructured Data
Unstructured data is qualitative, describing the characteristics of an event or an object.
E.G Binary,Audio,image,video &large text.
Key-unique identifier
Key-Filename
Value- Content of a file

Semi-Structured Data
Semi-structured data is data that has structure and that is not tabular.

# Categories of data
-Quantitive vs Qualitive
-Discrete vs Continous
-Categorical & Dimensional

 # Machine data source:
 -IOT devices,smartphones,tablets, PCs & servers
 # Unstructured data
 includes the KEY & VALUE

   # CHAPTER 3!!! Databases & Data Acquisition
