# Data-Analytics
   # CHAPER 1 !!!

# Computing with confidence user
-Knows to cope when things go wrong
-Knows how to learn new computing skills independently.
  # Data Analytics skills
-Machine learning 
-data visualization

  # Data Analytic roles:

*Data collection & preparation
* Data Analysis
* Data visualization &storytelling
* Decision support
* Collaboration & communication
* Continuous learning & adaptation
   # Data Analytic Responsibilities :
-Manages the delivery of user satisfaction surveys    & report on results using data visualization software
-Work with business line owners to develop requirements,define success metrics,manage & execute analytical pojects and evaluate results.

-Design,Build,Test & maintain backend code.
   # Steps When approaching a new project
*Define the questions-defining a problem
*Collect data-primary/internal
*Clean the data-prepare& fix the missing data
*Analyze data
*Interprete & share the solution /results
   # PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
 -SQL, Oracle & Python
 For data analytics to prosper there has to be: Data, Storage & Computing
   # Processes for data analaytics:
-Data acquistion
-Cleaning & manipulation
-Analysis,Visualization,Reporting & Communication
  # Data Analytic Techniques
Descriptive,Predictive & Prescriptive


Artificial intelligence (AI) includes any type of technique where you are attempting to get a computer system to imitate human behavior.
Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI techniques.
Deep learning is a further subdivision of machine learning that uses quite complex techniques, known as neural networks, to discover knowledge in a particular way. Used for image,video & sound.
Data Governance programs: ensures that the organization has high-data quality & able to effectively control the data
# Analytics tool
Excel or Google sheets

 # CHAPTER 2 !!!!
 # Tools for representing tabular data
*Microsoft Excel
*Google Sheets
*Apple numbers
Connection  between tables-- Relationship
Database softwares: Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL & Postgre SQL.

Structured data- organized into row & column
# Data Types:
-Character,text,Alphanumeric,clob &longtext
ASCII- includes upper & lowercase alphabets &numbers
Structured Data
Tabular data is structured data, with values stored in a consistent, defined manner, organized into columns and rows.
Unstructured Data
Unstructured data is qualitative, describing the characteristics of an event or an object.
E.G Binary,Audio,image,video &large text.
Key-unique identifier
Key-Filename
Value- Content of a file

Semi-Structured Data
Semi-structured data is data that has structure and that is not tabular.

# Categories of data
-Quantitive vs Qualitive
-Discrete vs Continous
-Categorical & Dimensional

 # Machine data source:
 -IOT devices,smartphones,tablets, PCs & servers
 # Unstructured data
 includes the KEY & VALUE

   # CHAPTER 3!!! Databases & Data Acquisition
   2 Categories:
   Relational& non-Relational database
 # ERD Cardinalities:
 *One
 *Many
 *One &one only
 *Zero or one
 *One or many
 # Benefits of Relational DB
 -Consistency,Stored procedures,Security& Locking
 ERD- Visual artifact of data modelling process.
 Unary relationship- When an entity has a connection with itself.
 Ternary relationship- connects 3 entities. 

 # Non-relational DB
 -key value,column store,gragh & dicument store.
 # Benefits of Non-Relational DB
 -Flexibility,Scalability & cost effictiveness.
 # Data base uses cases
 # Categories of Data Processing
 *OLTP- transfer encounters for everyday
 *OLAP- ability of organizations to analyze data using relational DB.

 # Normalization: process of minimizing the duplicates
 # 1NF -first Normal Form: 
 When a row in a table is unique & column contains unique values.
 # SCHEMA: 
 defines how data is organized within a relational DB
 
 # Data Mart:
 Subset of data warehouse
 # Data Lake:
 Capture any type of data. It store raw data & more complex than data warehouse or data mart.
  # Inner join statements
  Meaning there should be a table
  OLAP: denormalized
  OLTP:normalized
  # Dimensionality
  Refers to the number of attributes a table has. Higher attributes- higher dimensionality.

  SQL Keywords:
  CREATE
  READ
  UPDATE
  DELETE
  STDDEV
   # Chapte4 !!!!!
Missing values: issue that impacts data quality( null values)
Invalid:
-Values outside the valid range of a given attribute
Nonparametric data:
-Data collected from categorical variables
Data Outliers:
-Value that differs significantly from other pbservations in a dataset.
# Techniques for data analytics
*Recording data:
-Technique to map original values for a variable into a new value.
*Derived variable
*Data merge
*Data blending
*Concatenation
*Data append
*Imputation: replacing missing values

# Approaches used for imputing values:
-Remove missing data
-replace with zero
-Replace with overall average
-Replace with closest frequent mode
-Closest value average

Reduction: process of shrinking an extensive dataset.
*Dimensionality- removes attributes from a datset.
*Numerosity- reduces the overall volume of data.
# Data aggregation:
Summary of raw data for analysis

Transposition:
-turning row into column/ column into rows
Normalization:
-converts data from different scales to the same scale
min-max normalization- approach to normalizing data.

# SQL FUNCTIONS:
-Count, Min, Max, AVG, Sum, STDDEV
